Implementation of HMM (Local Ancestry Inferene)

## Step 1: Get the Data

1000 Genomes Project Phase 3

1. **Genetic Map**
   - Purpose: to consider the actual biological distances within the chromosome.
2. **Sample Panel**
   - Purpose: contains samples for both populations.
3. **VCF Slice**
   - The part of chromosome 22 that I'm going to test.

TODO:

- Write script to download the 3 files above (_did not push to git because files are too big_)
- Check sample file
